# Cubically

Cubically is a [work-in-progress](//github.com/cubically) complex esoteric programming language built for the study of Rubik's Cubes.

The most recent [version](//github.com/aaronryank/cubically/releases) of Cubically is [2.1](//github.com/aaronryank/cubically/releases/tag/v2.1).

# Interpreter

 - To build the interpreter, type `make`. This will generate the executable `rubiks-lang`.
 - To build the TryItOnline interpreter, which prints debugging information without color, type `make tio`. This will generate the executable `rubiks-tio`.
 - To build the visualizer, type `make visualizer`. This will generate the executable `visualizer`.
 - To clean up the object files after building, type `make clean`.

The interpreter is used like so:

    Usage: rubiks-lang <flags> <file | string> <size>
    Flags: f | second argument is a file
           s | second argument is a string
           u | read file/string as UTF-8
           c | read file/string as Cubically SBCS
    <size> specifies the size of the memory cube. If blank, a 3x3x3 will be assumed.

As a 3x3x3 memory cube is standard, it will be used throughout the tutorial and examples in the [docs](//github.com/aaronryank/Cubically/wiki).

# How to use

To learn how to use Cubically, check out [the Wiki!](//github.com/aaronryank/Cubically/wiki) It contains up-to-date information about every part of the language. Sometimes.
