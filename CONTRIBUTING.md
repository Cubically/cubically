[Cubically team](//github.com/Cubically) members should push changes directly to the Cubically organization's fork of Cubically, then open a pull request here.

Others wanting to contribute should open an [issue](//github.com/aaronryank/cubically/issues) and propose their change instead of directly opening a PR. Cubically's interpreter (and spec) changes frequently, so proposed changes may have to wait, and pull requests without approval will rarely be merged.

Outside contributors wishing to join the Cubically team should visit the [Cubically chatroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/62883/cubically).
